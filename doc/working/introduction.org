* Introduction
This project aims to develop a program serving as a recreation of the 1980 coin-op arcade game Pac-Man, using both the household high-level programming language Python and a 3rd party library to enable game development, Pygame.
The project aims at creating a rather conservative recreation of the original.
The core gameplay loop will be retained as much as possible by researching the original gameâ€™s mechanics, namely the mechanics of the ghosts: the algorithms that dictate where they will move, where they will move to and how to react to key game play moments.
Any features outside gameplay will be mostly cosmetic and or serves as a quality-of-life improvement for the player.
